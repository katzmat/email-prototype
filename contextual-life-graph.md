## 9. EMAIL HABITS & BEHAVIOR

### Inbox hygiene:
- **Unread tolerance:** Very high. 332 of 450 emails (74%) are unread. Matt runs a significant backlog.
- **Starring:** Zero starred emails in this sample. Does not use stars as a triage mechanism.
- **Important markers:** Only 5 of 450 marked important (by Gmail's algorithm, not manually).
- **Gmail tabs/categories:** CATEGORY_PROMOTIONS (207), CATEGORY_UPDATES (220), CATEGORY_SOCIAL (8), CATEGORY_PERSONAL (7). Heavy promotional and update volume.
- **Custom labels:** Label_43 (81 emails), Label_68 (80 emails) — purpose unknown from metadata alone.

### Triage strategy:
- **Leaves most emails unread.** Does not systematically mark-as-read or archive.
- **Self-sent emails as memory/records:** Sends himself meeting recap notes (Brownie Troop meeting), family letters. Uses email as a personal archive.
- **Active reading pattern:** Engages with school communications (ManageBac, Seesaw), healthcare scheduling, and Amazon order tracking. Likely scans subject lines for these.
- **Noise tolerance:** Very high. Political spam (27 TurnoutPAC), promotional (Old Navy, H&M, Fubo, Wyndham, Southwest), and marketing emails accumulate without action.

### Communication timing:
- **Evening activity:** Self-sent family letters at 11pm. School emails sent at 12:30pm and 8:13pm.
- **Typical active hours:** Late morning through late evening.
- **Therapy scheduling:** Morning slots (9am ET couples, 11am ET individual).

2. **Travel loyalty promos** (Southwest, AA, Wyndham — all unread)
3. **Retail promos** (Old Navy, H&M, Warmies marketing, MiniOlie)
4. **Streaming re-engagement** (Fubo — 4 emails, all unread)
5. **Most newsletters** (high unread rate even for tech newsletters)
